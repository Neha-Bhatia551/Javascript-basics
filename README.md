# JavaScript Basics 

This repository contains examples of JavaScript's foundational concepts and features. It demonstrates the use of various array methods, ES6 features, promises, async/await, and more. These examples serve as a quick reference or revision guide for JavaScript learners.

## Features and Topics Covered

### 1. Array Methods

#### Map
- Transforms elements in an array by applying a function.
- Example: Converting names to uppercase.

#### Filter
- Filters elements based on a condition.
- Example: Retrieving names of people with salaries greater than 300.

#### Find
- Finds the first element matching a condition.
- Example: Finding the first person with a salary greater than 300.

#### Reduce
- Aggregates array elements into a single value.
- Example: Summing up all salaries.

### 2. Fetching Unique Values
- Demonstrates the use of `Set` to extract unique categories from an array of objects.

### 3. Destructuring

#### Array Destructuring
- Extracts specific elements from arrays.
- Example: Assigning specific fruit names to variables.

#### Object Destructuring
- Extracts properties from objects.
- Example: Accessing nested object properties.

### 4. Spread and Rest Operators
- Spread: Expands elements of an array.
- Rest: Gathers remaining elements into an array.
- Example: Calculating the average of marks.

### 5. Optional Chaining
- Safely accesses nested object properties.
- Example: Retrieving time zones from an array of people.

### 6. Callbacks
- Functions passed as arguments to other functions.
- Example: Reversing a string or converting it to uppercase using a callback function.

### 7. Callback Hell
- Brief explanation of callback hell and a reference video for learning more.

### 8. Promises
- Asynchronous operations represented using promises.
- Example: A random number guessing game.

### 9. Async and Await
- Simplifies handling promises.
- Example: Fetching articles for a user using async/await.

### 10. Timestamps
- Logs the current date and time using `Date`.
